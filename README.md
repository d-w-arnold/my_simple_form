# The smallest web app

Write a HTML form with one field. Write a server in Node.js ([http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/)) that accepts the form value. The server should print out the value of the field to the console when called.

How to run:

- Navigate into the project root directory.

- Run the command: (requires Node.js to be installed, do not type the `$` prompt)

    ```
    $ node server.js
    ```

- Browse to: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

- Enter something in the field in my simple form, submit the form, and it will print out the value of the field to the console.
